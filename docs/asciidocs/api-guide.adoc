== Authentication and Authorization Operations

:operation-name: Authentication (Login)
:operation-description: All endpoints, accept this one, in asclepi-core are secured. \
                        Thus, any request to a secured endpoint produces 403 (Forbidden) response status. \
                        To gain access to secured endpoint, a requester must provide access token. \
                        This token is encrypted and contains all needed information for authorization. \
                        Requester gains access token by sending a valid request to this endpoint. \
                        To gain access to secured endpoints this token must be stored in 'Cookies' header of HTTP request.
